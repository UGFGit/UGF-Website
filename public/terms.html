        <h2>12. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>

        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted under applicable laws, You agree to
          hold harmless and indemnify the Foundation, its officers,
          shareholders, employees, agents, directors, subsidiaries, affiliates,
          successors, assigns, suppliers, or licensors from and against all
          third party claims and all liabilities, damages, assessments, losses,

        <h2>13. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h2>

        <p>
          These Terms set out the full extent of our obligations and liabilities
          with respect to the Website. To the maximum extent possible by law,
          the Foundation excludes all and any warranty, guarantee and
          responsibility in relation to or subsequent to the website and its
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Foundation shall in particular not be liable for any damages of
          any kind, including loss of income or data, suffered by the visitor,
          the user or any other person, by act of the Foundation or of a third
          party. This includes any misuse that would be made of the visitor’s
          and/or user’s data, any virus or other forms of malware transmitted
          through the website or the server, as well as any non-compliance of
          users and/or visitors with these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Foundation shall have no liability for any personal injury, lost
          profits or other consequential, special, punitive, indirect, or
          incidental damages, arising from or related to your use or inability
          to use the website.
        </p>

        <h2>14. LINKS</h2>

        <p>
          The Website may contain links which direct you to third-party
          websites. The Foundation rejects any liability on said third-party
          websites, which are solely provided in the Users’ and Visitors’
          interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Foundation has no influence on the content of third-party
          websites. The Foundation therefore cannot assume any guarantee for the
          accuracy, completeness or safety of this third-party content.
        </p>

        <h2>15. FORCE MAJEURE</h2>

        <p>
          The Foundation will not be deemed in default of these Terms to the
          extent that performance of its obligations is delayed or prevented by
          reason of any external force including, without limitation, war,
          insurrections, bank failures, strikes, fires, floods, earthquakes,
          labor disputes, epidemics, governmental regulations, freight
          embargoes, natural disaster, act of government or any other cause
          beyond Foundation’s reasonable control.
        </p>

        <h2>16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT & SEVERABILITY</h2>

        <p>
          These Terms, the Privacy Policy, the Cookies Policy, subject to any
          amendments or modifications made by the Foundation from time to time,
          shall constitute the entire agreement between you and the Foundation
          with respect to the use of the Website. If any provision of these
          Terms is found to be invalid by a court or competent jurisdiction,
          that provision only will be limited to the minimum extent necessary
          and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
        </p>

        <h2>17. NO WAIVER</h2>

        <p>
          The Foundation’s failure to enforce a provision of these Terms does
          not constitute a waiver of its right to do so in the future with
          respect to that provision, any other provision, or these Terms as a
          whole.
        </p>

        <h2>18. ASSIGNMENT</h2>

        <p>
          You may not assign any of your rights, licenses, or obligations under
          these Terms without the Foundation’s prior written consent. Any such
          attempt at assignment by you shall be void. The Foundation may assign
          its rights, licenses, and obligations under these Terms without
          limitation and without prior consent.
        </p>

        <h2>19. NO PARTNERSHIP</h2>

        <p>
          Nothing contained in this Terms of Service shall be deemed or
          construed to create a principal and agent, partnership or joint
          venture relationship between You and the Foundation.
        </p>

        <h2>20. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h2>

        <p>
          These Terms and your use of the Website, as well as all matters
          arising out of or in relation to them (including non-contractual
          disputes or claims and their interpretation), shall be governed by the
          laws of Switzerland. Any claim or dispute regarding these Terms or in
          relation to them shall (including for non-contractual disputes or
          claims and their interpretation) be subject to the exclusive
          jurisdiction of the Courts of Zug, Switzerland, subject to an appeal
          at the Swiss Federal Court.
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree that any dispute is personal to you and the Foundation, and
          that any dispute shall only be resolved by an individual litigation
          and shall not be brought as a class action, or any other
          representative proceeding. You agree that a dispute cannot be brought
          as a class or representative action or on behalf of any other person
          or persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case of dispute, you shall maintain the confidentiality of any
          proceedings, including but not limited to, any and all information
