              <h1>Our Mission</h1>
              <!-- <p>
                Structured towards innovation and evolution, the Utopia Genesis
                Foundation is laser-focused on creating new applications that
                leverage both powerful big-data resources at our disposal and
                the strength of blockchain technology to unlock a range of new
                tech possibilities for today’s music industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                The cornerstone offering of the Foundation and a key reason for
                its creation is the Genesis Application, which will be a
                marketplace for fractional tokenized ownership of music
                copyrights.
              </p> -->

              <div class="read_more">
                <div class="text2">
                  The tokenization of music ownership on the Genesis Application
                  is powerful in that it increases the pool of potential
                  investors into music exponentially by democratising ownership
                  and making it accessible to just about anyone. Not only will
                  it increase the pool of potential investors into music
                  copyrights, but it will create investors that are highly
                  incentivized to contribute however possible to the commercial
                  success of the copyrights that they have invested in.<br /><br />

                  Copyright holders, whether this is up and coming artists,
                  songwriters, producers, labels, catalogue owners or
                  publishers, will also benefit from a new potent means of
                  monetising their music rapidly. This can be incredibly
                  important considering how slow payment cycles can be in the
                  music industry. Take for example the loss of live performances
                  caused by the pandemic: a small artist whose live performance
                  revenues have been decimated could quickly tokenize and hence
                  monetize their music and invest the profits in marketing
                  campaigns to help boost their digital revenues. Such rapid
                  infusions of liquidity are rare to come by for copyright
                  holders in the music industry. <br /><br />

                  The tokenization of music copyrights by their owners is an
                  attractive proposition for copyright owners of all types,
                  including the emerging trend of copyright catalogue funds. The
                  sums of institutional investment funds that are looking into
                  music copyrights as an attractive alternative asset have never
                  been greater, particularly amidst the pandemic that has
                  encouraged investors to look for investments uncorrelated to
                  the markets. The biggest banks in the world are now looking at
                  the music industry with much interest ever since the recent
                  years of overall industry growth that have followed two
                  decades of declining revenues during the industry’s transition
                  to the digital world. Catalogue funds that we are in contact
                  with have already signalled their interest in tokenizing parts
                  of the catalogues that they acquire, as this presents a
                  potentially lucrative method of re-monetizing their assets.
                  Their interest in tokenizing parts of their assets will create
                  the engine that continues to pump more and more valuable
                  copyrights on to the marketplace and turns the market into a
                  self-sustaining organism. Ownership of classic catalogues that
                  have typically been reserved for the major labels and
                  publishers will now be made available to millions of fans,
                  many of whom will be very keen to own a portion of their
                  favourite song. Asides from our tokenisation initiatives, we
                  are also in a strong position to enable the creation of many
                  applications on subjects such as marketing effectiveness and
                  consumer understanding, tour planning, and even applications
                  that can collect even more data which can then be fed into the
                  platform. The possibilities are endless, and by allowing
                  members of the Foundation to access the data via an API and
                  develop their own applications, a stream of creativity will be
                  unleashed. <br /><br />All things considered, the Utopia
                  Genesis Foundation remains true to the mission statement of
                  the company, enhancing the music industry by helping it
                  leverage the power of modern technologies for the better. The
                  way the Foundation tackles this goal is by avoiding the
                  disruption of the current industry money flow, instead
                  creating new avenues of evolution for the industry by
                  leveraging the data that the company collects in innovative
                  ways, the most important of which is the tokenization of music
                  copyrights. By democratizing ownership of music copyrights and
                  capitalizing on the increased interest of institutional
                  investors into music copyrights, a blockchain-based
                  marketplace will evolve into an impressive secondary market
                  for copyrights and create profitable new methods of
                  monetisation for music copyright owners of all kinds.

                    Due to the complexity and time consuming nature of deal
                    negotiation between artists, publishers, and entities
                    looking to play the music, the industry created Performance
                    Rights Organizations (PROs), which act as intermediaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The nature of the music industry creates a spider’s web of
                    payments; one composition, which has one copyright, can be
                    recorded an infinite number of times, producing infinite
                    copyrights. These, in turn, can be played by multiple
                    entities, from radio stations to concert halls. The PROs
                    receive money from these entities, but because there has
                    never been a central database to keep track of who is owed
                    what, huge sums of money often end up sitting,
                    undistributed, with the PROs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is the Black Box; collected but undistributed revenue.
                    While it is difficult to know how much money sits
                    undelivered, the conservative approximation is about $2.5
                    billion annually, in the West alone. Some members of the
                    industry put the approximation as high as $5-8 billion.

                    Even if (and it is a big if) a PRO knows whom to pay, the
                    internal mechanisms used to determine this information, and
                    execute the transactions to thousands of artists across the
                    globe, result in a lengthy payment process.

                  <p>
                    It is not uncommon for artists and musicians to be paid more
                    than two years after their music has been played.

                    There is an incredible pool of music consumption data that
                    simply isn’t collected. While the digital shift has
                    facilitated a growth in music consumption, the tools used to
                    track the consumption have not developed adequately. Now
                    that every phone in every restaurant, mall, and hairdresser
                    across the world is playing music, the data simply falls
                    under the radar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through our pilot projects to determine the scale of the
                    untapped data, assessed alongside the current data of season
                    industry experts, we estimate that as much as $50 billion
                    worth of data remains uncollected every year.

                The problem is simple: there is no transparency in the music
                industry. People don’t know who is owed what.
              </p>
              <p>
                By offering a service that tracks whose music is played when and
                where, and which parties are owed what, we offer this
                transparency.

                The UOP will create value for each entity in the music industry,
                from offering record labels geographic consumption data to help
                plan artist tours, to record labels being able to hedge their
                investment through buying half the rights to a catalog, and
                putting the rest on the open market.
              </p>
              <p>
                The possibilities expand - hedge funds looking for an
                investment? Publishers looking for the next big thing? There is
                no end to how the UOP can be applied.

                technology, and funding, while anchoring Utopia to the values
                blockchain represents to its community: decentralization,
                equity, and transparency.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Utopia Open Platform is founded on the open-source
                principles nascent to a blockchain. The Open Platform allows
                third-party developers access to the valuable data of the parent
                company, Utopia Music AG.
              </p>
              <p>
                As applications are deployed in the ecosystem, we will be able
                to map out the complete landscape of the music industry.
